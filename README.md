# docs

Community docs for Shakti's k7.

Trial versions of k7 for macOS and Linux can be downloaded from anaconda:

https://anaconda.org/shaktidb

The docs are a clickable version of the k7 quickref, accessible in k7 with `\`.

To add a page:

1. Select a word that you'd like to contribute docs for in the quickref
2. In the public folder:
    1.  create a '.k' file starting with that word, and
    2.  add it to the `pages` array in `index.html`.

Edit pages by editing the corresponding '.k' file in the public folder.

TODO:

* ...write...more...docs?
* Figure out how to sync `index.html` with changes to the quickref (may need Shakti's help)
